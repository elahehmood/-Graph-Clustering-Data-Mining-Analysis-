## Introduction üí°  

<span id="span_5">Graph clustering, also known as **community detection**, is the process of identifying tightly connected groups of nodes within a graph.</span> <span id="span_6">This process improves visualization and understanding of complex networks.</span>  

### Applications  
- <span id="span_7">**Social Networks**: Detecting user communities</span>  
- <span id="span_8">**Biological Networks**: Identifying functional gene/protein modules</span>  
- <span id="span_9">**Marketing**: Segmenting customer groups</span>

## Graph Clustering & Community Detection üï∏Ô∏è  

<span id="span_10">In networks, communities are subgroups with dense internal links and sparse external connections.</span> <span id="span_11">Community detection is crucial for understanding hidden structures.</span>

## Girvan-Newman Algorithm üîç  

### Working Principle  
* Remove edges with the highest **betweenness centrality**.  
* Recompute betweenness after each removal.  
* Repeat until the graph splits into communities.  

### Steps  
1. Calculate betweenness centrality of all edges.  
2. Remove edge with highest betweenness.  
3. Recalculate and repeat.  

### Example  
Applied on a sample network with nodes **A‚ÄìF**, resulting in multiple community splits.  

### Advantages  
- Suitable for **small/medium graphs**  
- Detects **hierarchical structures**  

### Disadvantages  
- **High computational complexity**  
- Sensitive to **noise**  
- Not scalable for **large graphs**

## Louvain Algorithm ‚ö°  

### Overview  
<span id="span_20">The Louvain method optimizes **modularity** to find communities efficiently, especially in large networks.</span>  

### Steps  
1. **Local Modularity Optimization** ‚Äì move nodes between communities for max modularity.  
2. **Community Aggregation** ‚Äì merge nodes into super-nodes, repeat process hierarchically.  

### Formula for Modularity  
\[
Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{ij} \Big[ A_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \Big] \delta(c_i, c_j)
\]

## Conclusion & Future Work üèÅ  

### Conclusion  
<span id="span_30">Both Girvan-Newman and Louvain algorithms are effective, but Louvain is preferred for large-scale, real-world networks due to its efficiency.</span>  

### Future Work  
- Extend analysis to **dynamic networks**  
- Apply **hybrid algorithms**  
- Test on **real-world datasets** (social media, biological networks)
